# Blender Script Proof of Concept

This is a proof of concept for running Blender with a Python script on Colab. The script creates a plane and six spheres at random positions on the plane, creates a camera and sets its position and rotation, creates a path for the camera to follow, sets the camera to follow the path, sets the render engine to Eevee and sets the output file format and name, sets the render resolution as 720p and renders the animation.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook in Colab.
2. Run the cells in order.
3. The output video file will be saved in the `/content` directory.

## Modifications

This script can be modified to create different types of animations by changing the parameters of the functions used to create objects in Blender. For example, you can change the number of spheres created or their size, change the position and rotation of the camera or change the shape of the path that it follows.

## Interesting Use Cases

1. Create a 3D model of a building or landscape and animate a camera fly-through.
2. Create an animated logo for a company or product.
3. Create an animated short film or music video.
4. Create an animated visualization of data or scientific concepts.
5. Create an animated game prototype.
